My name is Alberto. I am a PhD student in economics at KU Leuven in Belgium, working under the supervision of [Christian Proebsting](https://sites.google.com/site/proebstingchristian/home).

My research interest is in macroeconomics with heterogeneity. I carry out data-driven research to study shocks propagate across regions within a country or among countries in a monetary union, and I analyze the aggregate effects of this heterogeneity. To address these questions, I combine novel microdata with structural models.

My research is funded by the FWO fundamental research grant.

I grew up in the beautiful wine region of [La Rioja](https://www.spain.info/en/region/la-rioja/), in Northern Spain.

      <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
      A large literature has used the variance decomposition framework by Asdrubali et al. (1996) to empirically evaluate the strength of various risk-sharing mechanisms across regions in a currency union. Following this approach, we find that only 17% of GDP fluctuations translate into per-capita consumption fluctuations across U.S. states, compared to 62% for euro area countries. However, we show that the benefits of risk sharing could be significantly greater than these figures suggest. We calibrate a DSGE model of a small open economy to match these empirical findings and show that if euro area countries adopted risk-sharing mechanisms similar to those across U.S. states, the volatility of consumption would be cut by a factor of more than 3.
